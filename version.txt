version 0.21 beta corrected error in xrfwang  date June 10th 2004

Version 0.20 beta release for scatter calculations. Scatter code
has been verified experimentally for a small number of systems
by comparison of calculated slope values against measurement
of the intensity  of the fluorescence of the pure element. Furthermore
the code for the treatment of tube filters was corrected for all
calculation procedures in gen_spec.c

Version 0.19 alfa release for scatter calculation date  Feb 7th 2004

Feb 7th 2004 added influence of Rayleigh and Compton scatter
in double photon interactions; new menu items : calibrate with
scatter, simulate with scatter and analyze smplx/scatter

Feb 11th 2003 new emutable.dat and gen_spec.c
to spread charac wavelength effect over 2 spectrum points
In \xrf\bin now also simmul.exe and xrfmul.exe
Sources of these are in external directories


Oct 19th 1998 Changed the spec_gen.c file to handle characteristic
radiation of tube anode better

Oct 29th 1998 changed enhanc.c file to exclude enhancement of lines
with lambda < lambda0

Dec 7th 1998 updated userman.ps with installation procedure
             and compiled binaries with C++ version5 + optimizations

Feb 15th 1999 changed calibratie.c : corrected memory allocation
              for sigmxx etc. and added calcn of stdev for slope
              in this routine

June 1999    2nd correction of gen_spec.c
             and improved intrasecflu.c

Nov 1999     added wangs ratio method (modified) see
             "non-destructive analysis of small irregularly
              shaped homogeneous samples by X-ray fluorescence
              spectrometry"
              M.Bos, J.A.M. Vrielink, W.E. van der Linden
              Anal.Chim.Acta, to be published.

              changed xrfrous to convert calculated elemental
              composition to compound composition of sample.

April 2001    Changed file enhanc.c to use absorption edges
              instead of wavelengths in condition tests for
              enhancement


Oct 2001      Changed xrfcombi and xrfsmplx.c xrfsmplx.exe
              to suit Louise Vrielinks' needs for more
              readable output of results from analyze with
              xrfsmplx, i.e. line names instead of numbers
              and including original measured intensities
